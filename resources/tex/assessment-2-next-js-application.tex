\section*{Assessment Overview}
In this \textbf{individual} assessment, you will replicate the given application on \textbf{Heroku} using \textbf{Next.js}. The main purpose of this assessment is to demonstrate your ability to develop an application using various taught frontend concepts. However, you will be required to independently research \& implement more complex concepts. In addition, marks will be allocated for code elegance, documentation \& \textbf{Git} usage.

\section*{Learning Outcome}
At the successful completion of this course, learners will be able to:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Apply design patterns \& programming principles using software development best practices.
	\item Design \& implement full-stack applications using industry relevant programming languages.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Conditions of Assessment}
You will complete this assessment during your learner-managed time. However, there will be time during class to discuss the requirements \& your progress on this assessment. This assessment will need to be completed by \textbf{Wednesday, 09 November 2022} at \textbf{2.59 PM}.

\section*{Pass Criteria}
This assessment is criterion-referenced (CRA) with a cumulative pass mark of \textbf{50\%} over all assessments in \textbf{ID608001: Intermediate Application Development Concepts}.

\section*{Authenticity}
All parts of your submitted assessment \textbf{must} be completely your work. If you use code snippets from \textbf{GitHub}, \textbf{StackOverflow} or other online resources, you \textbf{must} reference it appropriately using \textbf{APA 7th edition}. Provide your references in the \textbf{README.md} file in your repository. Failure to do this will result in a mark of \textbf{zero} for this assessment.

\section*{Policy on Submissions, Extensions, Resubmissions \& Resits}
The school's process concerning submissions, extensions, resubmissions \& resits complies with \textbf{Otago Polytechnic} policies. Learners can view policies on the \textbf{Otago Polytechnic} website located at \href{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}.

\section*{Submission}
You \textbf{must} submit all project files via \textbf{GitHub Classroom}. Here is the URL to the repository you will use for your submission â€“ \href{https://classroom.github.com/a/Ys5M8rKj}{https://classroom.github.com/a/Ys5M8rKj}.  Create a \textbf{.gitignore} \& add the ignored files in this resource - \href{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/main/Node.gitignore}{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/main/Node.gitignore}. The latest project files in the \textbf{master} or \textbf{main} branch will be used to mark against the \textbf{Functionality} criterion. Please test before you submit. Partial marks \textbf{will not} be given for incomplete functionality. Late submissions will incur a \textbf{10\% penalty per day}, rolling over at \textbf{3.00 PM}.

\section*{Extensions}
Familiarise yourself with the assessment due date. If you need an extension, contact the course lecturer before the due date. If you require more than a week's extension, a medical certificate or support letter from your manager may be needed.

\section*{Resubmissions}
Learners may be requested to resubmit an assessment following a rework of part/s of the original assessment. Resubmissions are to be completed within a negotiable short time frame \& usually \textbf{must} be completed within the timing of the course to which the assessment relates. Resubmissions will be available to learners who have made a genuine attempt at the first assessment opportunity \& achieved a \textbf{D grade (40-49\%)}. The maximum grade awarded for resubmission will be \textbf{C-}.

\section*{Resits}
Resits \& reassessments \textbf{are not} applicable in \textbf{ID608001: Intermediate Application Development Concepts}.

\section*{Instructions}
You will need to submit an application \& documentation that meet the following requirements:

\subsection*{Functionality - Learning Outcomes 1, 2, 3 (50\%)}
\begin{itemize}
	
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Code Elegance - Learning Outcome 1 (35\%)}

	\item Variables, functions \& components are named appropriately.
	\item Idiomatic use of control flow, data structures \& in-built functions.
	\item Sufficient modularity, i.e., UI split into independent reusable pieces.
	\item File header comment for each component explaining its purpose using \textbf{JSDoc}.
	\item Code is linted \& formatted using \textbf{ESLint} \& \textbf{Prettier}.
	\item \textbf{ESLint}, \textbf{Prettier} \& \textbf{Commitizen} are installed as \textbf{development dependencies}.
