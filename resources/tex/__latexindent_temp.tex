\section*{Instructions}

\subsection*{Functionality - Learning Outcome 1 (100\%)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Task One - Tic-Tac-Toe (25\%):}
	      \begin{itemize}
	      	\item You can not start to code the solution for this task without completing the formative assessments outlined in the  \textbf{08-react-recap.md} \& \textbf{09-styling.md} files. This is worth (5\%).
	      	\item In this sub-problem, you will implement conditional rendering such that the colour of X is yellow and the colour of O is blue. In the \textbf{Square.css} file, create two \textbf{CSS} rules called \textbf{.isX} \& \textbf{.isO}. Give each rule a \textbf{color} property with the appropriate value. In the \textbf{Square.js} file, implement conditional rendering using the two \textbf{CSS} rules in the \textbf{Square.css} file in the \textbf{button} element's \textbf{className} property. This is worth (10\%).
	      	\item In this sub-problem, you will implement a scoreboard which keeps track of how many times X wins, O wins and draws. Store the scoreboard as state using the \textbf{useState} hook. The scoreboard state is an object with the keys - x, o and draw (all lowercase). Each key has the value 0 (zero). If you encounter the following error - \textbf{Too many re-renders. React limits the number of renders to prevent an infinite loop}, you need to set the scoreboard state using the \textbf{useEffect} hook. To get you started, the logic for X is:
	      	      \begin{verbatim}
    useEffect(() => {
        if (winner === "X") setScoreboard((prev) => ({ ...prev, X: prev.X + 1 });
    }, [winner]);
	      	      \end{verbatim}
	      	      
	      	      
	      	      Display the scoreboard state in the following format - \textbf{X: 0,  O: 0, Draw: 0}. \textbf{Note:} You do not need to store the scoreboard state in any storage, i.e., \textbf{Local Storage} or \textbf{Session Storage}. This is worth (10\%).
	      	      
	      	      
	      	      
	      \end{itemize}
	      
	\item \textbf{Task Two - Book Library (25\%):}
	      \begin{itemize}
	      	\item You can not start to code the solution for this task without completing the formative assessment outlined in the  \textbf{10-context-api.md}. This is worth (5\%).
	      	\item In this sub-problem, you will calculate the cart's total at checkout. In the \textbf{Checkout.js} file, calculate the cart's total using the \textbf{reduce} function or a similar implementation. To access the cart, you need to use the \textbf{useContext} hook which accepts a context object, i.e., \textbf{CartContext} and returns the current context value, as given by the nearest context provider, i.e., \textbf{CartContext.Provider} for the given context. This is worth (10\%).
	      	\item In this sub-problem, you will implement deleting a book from the cart at checkout. In the \textbf{CartContext.js} file, you have a function that enables adding a book to the cart. Create a function that enables deleting a book from the cart. Again, to access the functions (adding and deleting), you need to  use the \textbf{useContext} hook. This is worth (10\%).
	      \end{itemize}
	      \textbf{Expect Output}:
	\item \textbf{Task Three - Sass (15\%):} In this repository, you have been given a file called \textbf{styles.css}. Create a new file called \textbf{styles.sass}. In the \textbf{styles.sass} file, convert the \textbf{CSS} rules in the \textbf{styles.css} to use \textbf{Sass} syntax. The \textbf{styles.sass} file needs to demonstrate the use of variables and nesting.
	      
	\item \textbf{Task Four - Component Testing (20\%):}	
	\item \textbf{Task Five - Storybook (15\%):}		
	      
	      \textbf{Expect Output}:
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Information}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Do not} rewrite your \textbf{Git} history. It is important that the course lecturer can see how you worked on your assessment over time.
	\item There are several mistakes you can make with take-home challenges. Some of these are minor mistakes, while others are major mistakes that will leave you frustrated and unable to successfully complete the assessment. Here are some mistake you can make: 
	      \begin{itemize}
	      	\item Time management
	      	\item Trying to learn too many new things at once. Remember, you only have 48 hours to complete this assessment
	      	\item Making too many assumptions
	      	\item Starting to code without proper planning
	      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
