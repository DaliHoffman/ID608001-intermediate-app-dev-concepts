\section*{Assessment Overview}
In this \textbf{individual} assessment, you will develop a \textbf{RESTful API} using \textbf{Node.js} and deploy it to \textbf{AWS}. The main purpose of this assessment is to demonstrate your ability to develop a \textbf{RESTful API} using the various taught intermediate concepts. However, you will be required to independently research and implement more complex intermediate/advanced concepts. In addition, marks will be allocated for code elegance, documentation and \textbf{Git} usage.\\

Due to a nation-wide lockdown, your local pub is no longer able to run their weekly quiz night onsite. Your local pub owners know you are an IT student and ask if you want create an online quiz night application for them. For the first step, the pub owners want a \textbf{RESTful API} that provides various functions for registering, logging in, participating in various quizzes and keeping track of scores so that they can give away prizes at the end of each quiz night.

\section*{Learning Outcome}
At the successful completion of this course, learners will be able to:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Apply design patterns and programming principles using software development best practices.
	\item Design and implement full-stack applications using industry relevant programming languages.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Conditions of Assessment}
You will complete this assessment during your learner-managed time. However, there will be time during class to discuss the requirements and your progress on this assessment. This assessment will need to be completed by \textbf{Monday, 17 October 2022} at \textbf{7.59 AM}.

\section*{Pass Criteria}
This assessment is criterion-referenced (CRA) with a cumulative pass mark of \textbf{50\%} over all assessments in \textbf{ID608001: Intermediate Application Development Concepts}.

\section*{Authenticity}
All parts of your submitted assessment \textbf{must} be completely your work. If you use code snippets from \textbf{GitHub}, \textbf{StackOverflow} or other online resources, you \textbf{must} reference it appropriately using \textbf{APA 7th edition}. Provide your references in the \textbf{README.md} file in your repository. Failure to do this will result in a mark of \textbf{zero} for this assessment.

\section*{Policy on Submissions, Extensions, Resubmissions and Resits}
The school's process concerning submissions, extensions, resubmissions and resits complies with \textbf{Otago Polytechnic} policies. Learners can view policies on the \textbf{Otago Polytechnic} website located at \href{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}.

\section*{Submission}
You \textbf{must} submit all project files via \textbf{GitHub Classroom}. Here is the URL to the repository you will use for your submission â€“ \href{https://classroom.github.com/a/i4G4NwNS}{https://classroom.github.com/a/i4G4NwNS}.  Create a \textbf{.gitignore} and add the ignored files in this resource - \href{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/main/Node.gitignore}{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/main/Node.gitignore}. The latest project files in the \textbf{master} or \textbf{main} branch will be used to mark against the \textbf{Functionality} criterion. Please test before you submit. Partial marks \textbf{will not} be given for incomplete functionality. Late submissions will incur a \textbf{10\% penalty per day}, rolling over at \textbf{8:00 AM}.

\section*{Extensions}
Familiarise yourself with the assessment due date. If you need an extension, contact the course lecturer before the due date. If you require more than a week's extension, a medical certificate or support letter from your manager may be needed.

\section*{Resubmissions}
Learners may be requested to resubmit an assessment following a rework of part/s of the original assessment. Resubmissions are to be completed within a negotiable short time frame and usually \textbf{must} be completed within the timing of the course to which the assessment relates. Resubmissions will be available to learners who have made a genuine attempt at the first assessment opportunity and achieved a \textbf{D grade (40-49\%)}. The maximum grade awarded for resubmission will be \textbf{C-}.

\section*{Resits}
Resits and reassessments \textbf{are not} applicable in \textbf{ID608001: Intermediate Application Development Concepts}.

An \textbf{admin} user can get all \textbf{admin} and \textbf{basic} users' information and update all \textbf{basic} users' information. A \textbf{basic} user can register.
		\item When performing a \textbf{POST} request for registering a \textbf{basic} user, the following error checking must be implemented:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item First name has a minimum length of two characters, a maximum length of 50 characters and alpha characters only.
